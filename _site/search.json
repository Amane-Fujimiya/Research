Most of them are incomplete, and are welcoming adoption from certain collaboration if requested or encouraged. While this is not always up-to-date (as I have an internal organization structure), it should be, most of the time adequate. For now, let us construct the main foundation on what are we going to do with the short-term papers and not the long-term, 2.5 years waitlist papers."

    "text": "Docker\n\nDevito Docker image library\nIn order to facilitate the dissemination, usage, and development of Devito, we provide a series of Docker images. These images support numerous architectures and compilers and are tagged accordingly. You can find all the available images at DevitoHub. The following describes the available images and the workflow to build it yourself.\n\nDevito images\nDevito provides several images that target different architectures and compilers. In the following, all images are described as imagename-*. The * corresponds to, and should be swapped for, the different release tags dev, latest or vx.x.x depending on if you are interested in specific versions (vx.x.x), the latest stable release(latest), or the latest development status (dev).\n\n\nDevito on CPU\nWe provide two CPU images: - devito:gcc-* with the standard GNU gcc compiler. - devito:icx-* with the Intel C compiler for Intel architectures.\nThese images provide a working environment for any CPU architecture and come with Devito, gcc/icx and mpi preinstalled, and utilities such as jupyter for usability and exploration of the package.\nTo run this image locally, you will first need to install docker. Then, the following commands will get you started:\n# Pull image and start a bash shell \ndocker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest /bin/bash\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 --device=/dev/infiniband/uverbs0 --device=/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest /bin/bash\n\n# or start a Jupyter notebook server on port 8888\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest\nAlternatively, to run in user context on a cluster with a shared filesystem, you can add the correct user config as docker options, e.g.:\ndocker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -u $(id -u):$(id -g) devitocodes/devito:gcc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py\nNotes: In addition, the following legacy tags are available:\n\ndevito:cpu-* that corresponds to devito:gcc-*\n\n\n\nDevito on GPU\nSecond, we provide three images to run Devito on GPUs, tagged devito:nvidia-nvc-*, and devito:amd-*.\n\ndevito:nvidia-nvc-* is intended to be used on NVidia GPUs. It comes with the configuration to use the nvc compiler for openacc offloading. This image also comes with CUDA-aware MPI for multi-GPU deployment.\ndevito:amd-* is intended to be used on AMD GPUs. It comes with the configuration to use the aoompcc compiler for openmp offloading. This image also comes with ROCm-aware MPI for multi-GPU deployment. This image can also be used on AMD CPUs since the ROCm compilers are preinstalled.\n\n\nNVidia\nTo run the NVidia GPU version, you will need nvidia-docker installed and to specify the GPUs to use at runtime with the --gpus flag. See, for example, a few runtime commands for the NVidia nvc images.\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -it devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py\n\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8787:8787 -p 8786:8786 --device=/dev/infiniband/uverbs0 --device=/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm  devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest\nor to run in user context on a cluster with a shared filesystem, you can add the correct user config as docker options, e.g.:\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -u $(id -u):$(id -g) devitocodes/devito:nvidia-nvc-latest python examples/seismic/acoustic/acoustic_example.py\n\n\nAMD\nUnlike NVidia, AMD does not require an additional Docker setup and runs with the standard docker. You will, however, need to pass some flags so that the image is linked to the GPU devices. You can find a short walkthrough in these AMD notes for their TensorFlow GPU Docker image.\nNotes: In addition, the following legacy tags are available:\n\ndevito:gpu-* that corresponds to devito:nvidia-nvc-*\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a Devito image\nTo build the images yourself, you only need to run the standard build command using the provided Dockerfile. The main difference between the CPU and GPU images will be the base image used.\nTo build the (default) CPU image, run:\ndocker build --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito .\nTo build the GPU image with openacc offloading and the nvc compiler, run:\ndocker build --build-arg base=devitocodes/bases:nvidia-nvc --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito .\nor if you wish to use the amdclang compiler with openmp offloading for AMD architectures:\ndocker build --build-arg base=devitocodes/bases:amd --network=host --file docker/Dockerfile --tag devito .\n\n\nDebugging a base image\nTo build the base image yourself locally, you need to run the standard build command using the provided Dockerfile. Following this, we build the Devito image using the previously built base:\ndocker build . --file docker/Dockerfile.cpu --tag devito-gcc --build-arg arch=gcc\ndocker build . --file docker/Dockerfile.devito --tag devito_img --build-arg base=devito-gcc:latest\nand then, to run tests or/and examples using the newly built image\ndocker run --rm --name testrun devito_img pytest -k \"not adjoint\" -m \"not parallel\" tests/\ndocker run --rm --name testrun devito_img py.test --nbval -k 'not dask' examples/seismic/tutorials/\n\n\nDeveloping Devito with Docker\nFor those aiming to develop in Devito using Docker, you can use docker-compose. We start by cloning the repo and entering the Devito directory.\ngit clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git\ncd devito\n\nExample CPU\n# Start a terminal to develop/run for CPUs using docker compose\ndocker-compose run devito /bin/bash\n\n\nExample GPU\n# Start a terminal to develop/run for GPUs using docker compose\ndocker-compose run devito.nvidia /bin/bash"

Depending on your needs, this might also be the recommended setup for using Devito in a production-like environment. However, since some components need to be compiled before use, this approach may be sensitive to the C/C++ compilers present on your system and the related environment, including what other packages you might have installed.\n\n\nconda route\nPlease install either Anaconda or Miniconda. Once install, you can create a virtual environment with eithera Python virtual environment or a Conda environment:\n# Create new env with the name devito\nconda create --name devito\n# Activate the environment\nconda activate devito\nand finally, install Devito along with any extra dependencies:\npip install devito\n# ... or to install additional dependencies\n# pip install devito[extras,mpi,nvidia,tests]\n\n\nFor developers\nFirst clone Devito:\ngit clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git\ncd devito\nand then install the requirements in your virtual environment (venv or conda):\n# Install requirements\npip install -e .\n# ...or to install additional dependencies\n# pip install -e .[extras,mpi,nvidia,tests]\n\n\nFacing issues\nIf you are facing any issues, we are happy to help on Slack_.

There should be not much going on here, however, you might as well treat it as my very own hub of operation at large, in public, for research, collaborations, et cetera. Also, I hate coding, so I will need something in here… quick. The template for this site is basically, devitoproject.org, of which I take for certain specification.\nMost of the content here right now are proposals, ideas, and research problems that I took virtue to describe and partake upon. Individual articles are set up here for reference purpose as to describe the research topic at large. For project, documentation purposes fit them neatly in such realm, and for documentation on various topics, we delegate such description to their own due."

Generally, I am fairly bad of practical application, though that is a front to improve upon. I am also interested in mathematics, including the theory of probability, category theory. Some of the potential topics then also includes theoretical computational model, type theory, and theoretical mathematical modelling."

Including effort to formalize the definition of it. Belong to [[Statistical Learning and GNN focus]].\nInterpreting double descent in polynomial via density estimation (original, theory): A fairly light and theoretical paper on the toy model description of polynomial model and different interpretation.\nDouble descent on support vector machine and polynomial models on binary classification - an analysis (experimental, theory): A both theory and experimental paper.\nPINNs and double descent (experimental): An experimental on PINNs and how to identify double descent on it.\nClassical learning theory and future (original, review, experiments).\nA review of model structures in machine learning and theoretical machine learning (theoretical, review, reference): A reference paper on the concept of models in machine learning, their structures, flavour, consideration, and thereof.\nDifferent treatment of machine learning - an analysis (review, reference, original): A paper on the different treatment of machine learning, from different lens and scale, and how do they fit together (categorical machine learning for example).\nReuniting the neural network framework using partial category theory (original, theory): Using the proposed categorical machine learning or neural network to consider reuniting different architecture together under the same framework.\nOn the capacity and capability of neural networks (review, original): A paper analysing the capacity and capability of neural networks on various task and setting thereof, and so forth, considering different structures.\nMachine learning from a mathematical modelling view (review, original): Proposing a modelling theoretic, internal state interpretation to machine learning.\nThe analysis of statistical physics on machine learning (review, original): Setting up a review work on how statistical physics is related to machine learning, where is it failing and what constitute the failure.\nClassical model into neural network architecture - an analysis (original, theoretical): An attempt to attack and formalize classical models into neural network theoretic (unit-wise approach of neuronal unit) to classical models, hence gauging their capability.\nUnsolved problems in theoretical machine learning (original, review): A work in review of different interpretations and problems residing the current framework of machine learning.\nDifferential equations and machine learning - interpreting machine learning system using differential equations (original, theory): An attempt to express ML systems in terms of differential equations, just as the differential model.\nLLM cannot be AGI - the kind of paper.\nNeural network learning equals mathematical model structural approximation (original, theory, experiment).\nConcentration inequalities in theoretical machine learning for beginner.\nStructural addition in machine learning - an analysis.\nComponent and structural realization of large language model and why they are not intelligent - just to prove that LLM is not, well, intelligent and again, won’t ever be AGI.\nHallucination is bias-variance tradeoff - we just, well, connect it to them.\nVisualization of neural network operation and layer theoretic.\nTime-sensitive processing network - something that look like an operational system in the inner units of the neural network, so yeah.\nAlways running neural network. Mimicking a network to well, always run and is not static.\nVisualizing dynamics and bias-variance plus double descent.\nInformation theoretic interpretation of machine learning framework.\nRandomized neural network architecture on permutations (theory, experiment, original) - just a way to do such analysis.\nMultiNet - A new multidirectional structure of neural network formalism (original, experimentation) - just a generalization of what I observed of neural network structure in general. Will have to base on existing facility, can’t do anything else.\nTheoretical explanation for Neural Scaling Law (original, theoretical) - Just an attempt to solve the neural scaling law.\n\nFor now, they are short papers for machine learning. On physics, well.\n\nThe theory of Raman Spectroscopy (review, reference): On the theory of Raman spectroscopy on itself, different interpretation, history, approaches, and problems. That is it for now. More is in the PDF file itself, which is listed there for reasons."

Note, there are situations where you leave off\n---\ntitle: your title\n---\nand start the qmd file with a level header #, but if using the default title yaml (in the --- fence) is a good habit since it makes it easy for Quarto convert your qmd file to other formats (like into a presentation)."
